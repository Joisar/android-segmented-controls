Segmented Controls for Android
==========================

This is yet another Just-4-Fun project of mine. In this project, I show ways to build Segmented Controls (from iOS 7) for Android. Note that there is no need for code overridden. Everything is accomplished by taking advantages of some sorts of XML drawables in conjunction with RadioGroup and its RadioButtons.
